<p>
Welcome to atman.io. <i>Atman</i> means <i>soul</i> or <i>self</i> in Sanskrit. Life is short. You should have the right to direct your life; everyone should. That's what technological innovation means to us--greater freedom and tools to live as you so choose.
</p>

<p>
Yet, increased automation and better technology has created fear of the unknown in people's lives. Why is this? Because those technologies and improvements aren't being harnessed in globally optimal ways. Corporations and governments thrive off of picking through and controlling your data. And as the world economy grows more connected and automated each day, the advantages multinational conglomerates and oppressive regimes grow stronger. And people around the world continue to live hand to mouth.</p>

<p>
Is this right? Is this the way to the future? It doesn't have to be that way.
</p>
<p>
We believe individual empowerment can happen more freely around the world if people could own their work history and trusted reputations. Switching cities, jobs, bosses, or industries should never reset you to ground zero. But these tools don't exist at a level beyond corporations. 
</p>
<p>
We are excited to build infrastructure for the inevitable borderless, peer-to-peer global cybereconomy that will emerge. So that everyone can benefit from more better and better technology.
</p>
<p>
We want to build tools that protect individual rights to their own human capital. 
</p>
<p>
We want to empower people globally to collaborate, create, and produce in new ways. 
</p>
<p>
And we will do this by leveraging the uncensorable nature and asymmetric defensive properties of blockchain technology to ensure the individual soverignty of human capital for every person on Earth--and beyond.
</p>
<p>
Join us in building the next generation of peer-to-peer human capital markets. Stay tuned for updates <a href="https://atman.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f44c07610a6b5073e87c96ab0&id=819f814cfc">here</a> as we pursue our mission to empower people around the world to coordinate their creative and productive energies in new ways.</p>
